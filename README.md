# Medical Insurance Cost Prediction

This project uses machine learning to accurately predict medical insurance costs by analyzing individual health data. By employing algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest, it aims to improve access to healthcare, optimize resource allocation, and reduce financial burdens associated with medical expenses. The goal is to provide actionable insights for better policy development within the insurance sector, enhancing decision-making and risk management practices.
